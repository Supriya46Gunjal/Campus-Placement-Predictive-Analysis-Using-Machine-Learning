This project predicts the likelihood of student placements in campus recruitment using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
Random Forests, and more. The model is trained on historical student data, including academic performance, skills, internships, and extracurricular activities,
to determine key factors influencing placement success.

Key steps include data preprocessing (cleaning, normalization), feature selection, and model training. 
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
The goal is to help educational institutions and students understand what factors impact placement outcomes and improve career guidance strategies.
